# Smart Glasses Prototype Demo 2

A simple React application for smart glasses prototyping.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed on your computer:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Download and install the LTS version)
- A code editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Getting Started

### For Windows Users:

1. Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd path\to\smart_glasses_prototype
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`

### For macOS Users:

1. First, install Homebrew (if you don't have it already):
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Node.js using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install node
   ```

3. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/smart_glasses_prototype
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`

## What's Next?

- The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the code
- You can stop the server at any time by pressing `Ctrl + C` (Windows) or `Cmd + C` (macOS) in the terminal
- To build the project for production, run:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure Node.js is properly installed by running:
   ```
   node --version
   ```

2. If you see any error messages about missing packages, try running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   again

3. If the page doesn't open automatically, try opening your browser and going to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. For macOS users, if you get any permission errors, you might need to run:
   ```
   sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
   ```
